## Submit to the community classifieds

We're experimenting with a very limited number of community classified ads in Pouch Issue #2! Inspired by the ads in [Bubbles Fanzine](https://www.instagram.com/p/C23QsOHPPRn/).

Details:
- **Size:** Each ad will be 2.5" by 2.5" (square).
- **Price:** Each ad spot costs $20.
- We will print up to 6 community classified ads in Pouch Issue 2.
