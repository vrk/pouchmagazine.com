## About _Pouch_

**Pouch** is a new magazine for journalers and stationery lovers. It features journaling ideas, stationery reviews and recommendations, a community layout gallery, DIYs, and more.

Pouch is currently produced, written, designed, and illustrated by a team of one: [me, vrk](https://www.victoriakirst.com/)! I am currently funding this 100% myself and operating out of my living room ðŸ˜† It is a passion project and labor of love!

Pouch Issue 1 is a pilot of the magazine! I'm going to figure out the future of Pouch after I see the reception of Issue 1.
