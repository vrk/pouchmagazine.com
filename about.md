## About _Pouch_

**Pouch** is a new magazine for journalers and stationery lovers. It features stationery reviews and recommendations, journaling ideas and inspiration, a community layout gallery, and more.

Pouch is currently produced, designed, written, and illustrated by a team of one: [me, vrk](https://www.victoriakirst.com/)! I am funding this 100% myself and operating out of my living room ðŸ˜† It is a passion project and labor of love!
