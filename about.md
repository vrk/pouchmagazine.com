[Pouch Issue 2](https://shop.pouchmagazine.com/b/pouch-issue-2) launched in Spring 2025 and is available for purchase on the store, either physically or digitally. Issue 2 includes article contributions from [Nikki Kaigi](https://www.instagram.com/nikki.kaigi/) and [Reytorra](https://www.instagram.com/reytorra), in addition to myself, [vrk](https://www.instagram.com/pouch.studio), and community contributions for the layout galleries and hot takes section.

Pouch is currently produced, designed, edited, and illustrated by a team of one: me, vrk! I am funding this 100% myself and operating out of my living room. It is a passion project and labor of love 💖
